The nginx binaries originally came from:
https://github.com/Guilouz/Creality-Helper-Script/raw/main/files/moonraker/nginx.tar.gz

Use the `scripts/recreate-nginx.sh` script to extract the nginx directory from:
https://github.com/Guilouz/Creality-Helper-Script/raw/main/files/moonraker/moonraker.tar.gz

The install/nginx.conf is originally from moonraker.tar.gz:nginx/nginx/nginx.conf, but I modified it locally to already
listen on port 80.

## Moonraker Env

The moonraker-env originally came from:
https://github.com/Guilouz/Creality-Helper-Script/raw/main/files/moonraker/moonraker.tar.gz

Use the `scripts/recreate-moonraker-env.sh` script to extract the moonraker/moonraker-env directory from:
https://github.com/Guilouz/Creality-Helper-Script/raw/main/files/moonraker/moonraker.tar.gz

I have updated the env to install the asyncio and updated apprise packages locally to avoid doing that at installation time.

## Helper Script

I have taken advantage of the fact helper script is open source to migrate some features from helper script to this project including:

- Some useful macros for fan control
- WARMUP macro

## Klipper

We are using my fork of klipper, which is mainline klipper, a fix for a temp sensor on the k1 and and a time out fix for bltouch, 
crtouch and microprobe to the mcu.py file.

### SSH Deploy Keys

I have issues with my internet and wifi in my workshop so often I get a timeout cloning the klipper repo, but there is
a way to use git ssh clone urls, its not ideal because moonraker can't use them but its just for testing, I generated the
ssh/identity key with:

```
dropbearkey -t ecdsa -f ~/.ssh/identity -s 256
```

I discovered how to do this from https://forum.archive.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=47551

This mode is activated by prefixing the call to the installer with `KLIPPER_GIT_CLONE=ssh`, its not for normal use as
cloning via ssh is much slower than via curl but it does not seem to timeout.

## MCU Util

In the future I hope to use the mcu_util.py to do firmware updates, this relies on pyserial which is preinstalled on the k1.
