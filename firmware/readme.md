# Custom Firmware

A script to create custom firmware providing firmware for the k1 that has been pre-rooted, ssh-enabled and 
my emergency firmware factory reset feature installed.  This is very minimal changes on top of the default
firmware it is not to compete with the pre-rooted firmware from Destinal which includes Moonraker, Fluidd, etc

**I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF YOU BRICK YOUR PRINTER - CREATING AND INSTALLING CUSTOM FIRMWARE IS RISKY**

## Why I did it?

I mostly did this so I could iterate my Simple AF K1 Klipper project, because factory resetting, configuring WIFI,
 then enabling root takes at least 1 minute.   With my `S58factoryreset` process it leaves the wifi configuration
 alone.

 I was considering packaging my Simple AF K1 Klipper as a firmware image, but I actually don't think that is such
 a good idea, as all you can do is create a `/etc/init.d` file that gets triggered on startup to actually
 do the install, and the user has no idea whether it succeeded or not!

## Prerequisites

You will need a linux machine with the following commands available, something like ubuntu or arch is fine:

- p7zip (7z command)
- wget
- unsquashfs
- mksquashfs

The packages on ubuntu can be installed like so:

```
sudo apt-get install p7zip squashfs-tools wget
```

Don't try and create this on windows or MacOs, you could do it on a ubuntu vm no problem

## Creating

Then you can create a new firmware file, currently without any customations just to test things work with:

```
export K1_FIRMWARE_PASSWORD='the password from a certain discord'
./create.sh
```

**NOTE:** You will be required to enter your `sudo` password

The resulting img file will be located at `/tmp/1.3.3.8-pellcorp/CR4CU220812S11_ota_img_V6.1.3.3.8.img`

## Testing

It's very important to test this in the safest way possible, luckily creality has provided a way to test
a new firmware image from the cli rather than relying on the display server

```
/etc/ota_bin/local_ota_update.sh /tmp/udisk/sda1/CR4CU220812S11_ota_img_V6.1.3.3.8.img
```

## Thanks

Thanks for destinal from discord for providing information about testing the image and also for providing 
the password creality uses for generating the image.

I also have used a couple of his init.d scripts which I got from
